# Setup

  > `git clone https://github.com/RyanCavanaugh/dt-mergebot.git`

  > `npm install`

# Running

Ask Ryan for the bot's auth token.
Don't run the bot under your own auth token as this will generate a bunch of spam from duplicate comments.

 > set AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 > npm run wet

# Development
