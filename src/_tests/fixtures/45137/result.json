Have you considered [adding tests](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#editing-tests-on-an-existing-package) to cover the change you're making? Including tests allows this PR to be merged by yourself and the owners of this module. This can potentially save days of time for you.\n\n## Code Reviews\n\nThis PR can be merged once it's reviewed by a DT maintainer.\n\n## Status\n\n * ✅ No merge conflicts\n * ✅ Continuous integration tests have passed\n * ❌ Only a DT maintainer can approve changes [without tests](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#editing-tests-on-an-existing-package)\n\nOnce every item on this list is checked, I'll ask you for permission to merge and publish the changes.\n\n----------------------\n... diagnostics scrubbed ..."
