Please consider [adding tests](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#user-content-adding-tests-to-a-new-package) to cover the change you're making. Including tests allows this PR to be merged by yourself and the owners of this module.\n\n***This can potentially save days of time for you!***"
